# Kunskapskontroll-F-rdjupad-Pythonprogrammering
Python package to pull data from an API, transform it and upload to a SQL-database.

In this instance we use data frpm Skatteverket - kommunalskatter.

The main.py contains the main script. Modules has been made för API, data cleaning and saving the data to SQL.
You will also find a script with tests.
A document "Självutvärdering".
And a printscreen of Schemaläggaren/taskmanager.

The data in it self is already thoroughly cleaned and formatted. 
This is why you will find that the exceptions in the code might seem superficial. 
However they are added, and with them I have made comments showing how we could pollute the data to trigger the exceptions.
