# Kunskapskontroll-F-rdjupad-Pythonprogrammering
Python package to pull data from an API, transform it and upload to a SQL-database.

In this instance we use data frpm Skatteverket - kommunalskatter.

The data in it self is already thoroughly cleaned and formatted. 
This is why you will see that the exceptions in the code might seem supeficial. 
However they are added, and with them I have made comments showing how we could pollute the data to trigger the exceptions.
